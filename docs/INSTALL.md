# INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR SQUIRK
Here's the complete installation guide for SQUIRK, with everything you have to think about.

## Before the installation
Before you can install the latest version of SQUIRK, you have to have installed some things. These are:
- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Python 3.7 or higher:** Required for running the setup, the complete main script and the SQK interpreter (make sure python is included in [PATH](docs/PATH.md)).

## The installation (via git repository)
Now before you can install anything, you have to clone the repository onto your machine with git. You do this in your command line. You can open it by pressing `WIN + R` and typing in `cmd`. After that, you have to navigate to the directory, where you want to be the cloned repository, by typing in:
```
cd [YOUR-DIRECTORY]
```

Now you can run the command to clone the repository onto your machine, into the directory you previously navigated to, by typing in the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/acariustv/SQUIRK.git
```

After that, you have to run the .bat (BATCH-script), by typing in the command line the following command:
```
setup.bat
```

This runs the setup for the complete SQUIRK functions. Now you are ready to go and type in your first command!
(If it doesn't work, then you have to check if the setup set everything correctly up and added the squirk.bat file into the PATH. Navigate into `C:\SQUIRK` and find the directory `bin`. Go into it and copy the adress and paste it in [PATH](docs/PATH.md). Now it should work correctly!)
